The_Last_Touhou_Project
=======================

Final project for MKS65C. **{{ Tears }}**

#To do:

###Make plot line. (cs dept themed! fite teachers for grades?!!?!?)

###Used Libraries
**Download SDL.**
::Figure out how to use SDL lmao 
::sketchy on if SDL includes the frame/container that java has 
::key inputs aren't part of SDL? or maybe used in c 
**Sound libraries!!!???**

**Design code flow (see .js file because i like the json layout)**

###storyline:
	<u>aim</u>: to include all current cs dept. teachers
	<i>that give us consent</i> to take their photos and
	use them.
	   disclaimer: we may or may not use bashing for 
	   satirical purposes ( stuybash is no more :( )
	
	each game level represents a year of cs a student takes
	     introCS: brooks, konstans, holmes, griffith
	     APCS: konstans, DW, zman, brown
	     softdev: zman
	     systems: dw
