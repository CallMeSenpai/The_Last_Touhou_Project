The_Last_Touhou_Project
=======================

Final project for MKS65C. **{{ Tears }}**

#To do:

###Make plot line. (cs dept themed! fite teachers for grades?!!?!?)

###Used Libraries
**Download SDL.**
::Figure out how to use SDL lmao <br>
::sketchy on if SDL includes the frame/container that java has <br>
::key inputs aren't part of SDL? or maybe used in c <br>
**Sound libraries!!!???**

**Design code flow (see .js file because i like the json layout)**

###storyline:
	<u>aim</u>: to include all current cs dept. teachers<br>
	<i>that give us consent</i> to take their photos and<br>
	use them.<br>
	   disclaimer: we may or may not use bashing for <br>
	   satirical purposes ( stuybash is no more :( )<br>
	<br>
	each game level represents a year of cs a student takes<br>
	     introCS: brooks, konstans, holmes, griffith<br>
	     APCS: konstans, DW, zman, brown<br>
	     softdev: zman<br>
	     systems: dw<br>
<br>
###debrief on each year (consists on topics learned):<br>
