=======================

Final project for MKS65C. **{{ Tears }}**<br>
Libraries needed:<br>
!! Library headers have been included in the local file.
<br>Install the actual package pls
<br>(I will update the list with windows and mac/other linux distros)
<br>(later.)
<br>for Ubuntu:
<br><code>sudo apt-get install libsdl2
<br>sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev??</code>
<br>if libsdl2-image-dev doesn't work add universe to your sources
<br>open /etc/apt/sources.list and add:<br>
<code>
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu saucy main universe
</code>

sudo apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-0
sudo apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
</code>
<br>
#To do:

###Make plot line. (cs dept themed! fite teachers for grades?!!?!?)
###Utilize (local) multiplayer as a systems aspect. ( Perhaps make it host on outer server? )

**Design code flow (see .js file because i like the json layout)**

###storyline:
<u>aim</u>: dw has given us permission to us photos of
   other teachers.<br>
   "It's easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission" - D.W. 2014<br>
   disclaimer: we may or may not use bashing for
   satirical purposes ( stuybash is no more :( )<br>	
   each game level represents a year of cs a student takes
     introCS: brooks, konstans, holmes, griffith
     APCS: konstans, DW, zman, brown
     softdev: zman
     systems: dw
###debrief on each year (consists on topics learned):

-intro-cs
- recursion
- the ill dr ratchet
- netlogo?

-apcs
- data structures: tree(each bullet forks off 2 more?), linkedlist
- java syntax and etc?
-???

-softdev
- ??? 

-systems
- SEGMENTATION FAULT
- ???
- segfault again, (game crashes on purpose?) or fake it


thoughts on spellcard (barak pls)

###barak delivers thoughts

-Raw ideas
- turtles
- standard bullet fire patterns
- recursion: bullets split and eventually come back to starting point
- more ideas to come...
