The_Last_Touhou_Project
=======================

Final project for MKS65C. **{{ Tears }}**<br>
Libraries needed:<br>
This is a linux systems class so lol<br>
<code>sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian<code/>

#To do:

###Make plot line. (cs dept themed! fite teachers for grades?!!?!?)
###Utilize (local) multiplayer as a systems aspect. ( Perhaps make it host on outer server? )

**Design code flow (see .js file because i like the json layout)**

###storyline:
	<html>
	<u>aim</u>: to include all current cs dept. teachers
	<i>that give us consent</i> to take their photos and
	use them.
	   disclaimer: we may or may not use bashing for 
	   satirical purposes ( stuybash is no more :( )
	
	each game level represents a year of cs a student takes
	     introCS: brooks, konstans, holmes, griffith
	     APCS: konstans, DW, zman, brown
	     softdev: zman
	     systems: dw
	</html>
###debrief on each year (consists on topics learned):

-intro-cs
- recursion
- the ill dr ratchet
- netlogo?

-apcs
- data structures: tree(each bullet forks off 2 more?), linkedlist
- 
-

-softdev
- 

-systems
- SEGMENTATION FAULT
- 
- segfault again, (game crashes on purpose?) or fake it
