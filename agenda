TODO::

advanced interpreter: put more options in the function
images of bullets and mobs and bosses
more shoot() funtions depending on the mob id

more intricate mob actions in interpreter
example:
mob
hp=x
blah=y
action //all variable settings after this will change, will give mob array of functions
hang=10
?shoot=20
angle=


level differences? perhaps cutting out half or 2/3 of bullets

options: select lives/bombs, etc

chat boxing, state of 4

bugs:
restart doesn't restart
fullscreen isn't fullscreen
