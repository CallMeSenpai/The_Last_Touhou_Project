TODO::

movement bounds
object projection
projection removal ( beyond the bounds )
get images, barak covered sprites already
pseudo timer using frame delay in "while(1)"

figure out how to put (patterned) enemies into a file and read it
--> making own interpreter for enemies/boss/bullet patterns

format? TBD:
[BULLET1]
speed:5
@@@@
hang:10 { keep moving 10 seconds }
action:
dist:10 { keep moving until 10 distance units }
action:
move-to:300,300
[MOB1]
move-to:300,300
hang:10
attack-1:30 { attack-1 for 30 seconds }

--> interpreter:
    each move will have a separate corresponding function
    and each mob/bullet will have an array of
    function pointers that will work in order

title-screen
pausing, figuring out time-paused
game-stages (and transition b/t stage)
game difficulties
chat-boxing?
