TODO::

edit bullets some more
make shoot() in levels shoot
start() in main => level=1 => call read file function.
make another array of monsters called mobs_to_summon()
summon monster after reading
still some images.

figure out how to put (patterned) enemies into a file and read it
--> making own interpreter for enemies/boss/bullet patterns

format? TBD:
[BULLET1]
speed:5
@@@@
hang:10 { keep moving 10 seconds }
action:
dist:10 { keep moving until 10 distance units }
action:
move-to:420,420
[MOB1]
move-to:420,720nosc0pee
hang:10
attack-1:30 { attack-1 for 30 seconds }

--> interpreter:
    each move will have a separate corresponding function
    and each mob/bullet will have an array of
    function pointers that will work in order

level selection images
level differences? perhaps cutting out half or 2/3 of bullets

options: select lives/bombs, etc

chat boxing, state of 4
